# MATH578F22CSULB

MATH 578 - Numerical Linear Algebra, Fall 2022

California State University -- Long Beach

The content of this course closely follows *Computational Linear Algebra for Coders* that was taught by Rachel Thomas (fast.ai) in USF Data Science program, which is accessible through this website: [https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/nbs/0.%20Course%20Logistics.ipynb](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/nbs/0.%20Course%20Logistics.ipynb). The course is taught in Python with Jupyter Notebooks, using libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlab, Pandas for most lessons, as well as Numba (a library that compiles Python to C for faster performance) and PyTorch (an alternative to Numpy for the GPU) in a few lessons. 

Throughout the semester, I will be using Jupyter Notebook to write most of my lecture notes and coding; while sometimes handwriting some mathematical derivations using notability. Meanwhile, I will record all my lecture videos. All the notability notes, jupyter notebook notes, and lecture videos will be linked under the Course Content below.
